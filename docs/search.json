      "contents": "\r\nfirst survey resultsHere you can see a profile of face-to-face negotiations and e-negotiations. Participants were asked about their personal experiences with negotiations in the two contexts (ftf vs.Â e-). The final goal is to create different profiles of negotiations and to discover possible trends in an explorative way.\r\n\r\nThis graphic shows what the content of the e-negotiation was. Most e-negotiations were about the employment contract of the survey participants themselves.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the e-negotiation context, the content that was negotiated most in face to face negotiations was buying a service\r\n\r\nFurther you can see which medium is used most by e-negotiators.\r\nAt this point I wanna thank Antony Berbert, who supported me with the creation of this website.\r\nHere you can visit his website: https://antonyberbert.github.io/RTraining/\r\nIf you read all this, thanks and enjoy this beautiful sunset picture of Basel :)\r\nBasel\r\n\r\n\r\n",
