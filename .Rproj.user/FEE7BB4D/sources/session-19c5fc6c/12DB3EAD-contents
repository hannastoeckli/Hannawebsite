Here you can see a profile of face-to-face negotiations and e-negotiations. Participants were asked about their personal experiences with negotiations in the two contexts (ftf vs. e-). The final goal is to create different profiles of negotiations and to discover possible trends in an explorative way.


At this point I wanna thank Antony Berbert, who supported me with the creation of this website.
