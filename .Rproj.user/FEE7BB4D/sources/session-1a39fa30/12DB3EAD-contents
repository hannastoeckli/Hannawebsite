![first survey results](negotiation.png)

Here you can see a profile of face-to-face negotiations and e-negotiations. Participants were asked about their personal experiences with negotiations in the two contexts (ftf vs. e-). The final goal is to create different profiles of negotiations and to discover possible trends in an explorative way.


![Content of e-negotiations](contente.png)
This graphic shows what the content of the e-negotiation was. Most e-negotiations were about the employment contract of the survey participants themselves.

![Content of ftf-negotiations](contentftf.png)
In contrast to the e-negotiation context, the content that was negotiated most in face to face negotiations was buying a service 


![Medium of e-negotiations](mediume.png)
Further you can see which medium is used most by e-negotiators. 


At this point I wanna thank Antony Berbert, who supported me with the creation of this website.
